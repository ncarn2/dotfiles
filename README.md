## My dotfile configuration

This is largely based off of [Abhishek Keshri's Dotfile Manager](https://github.com/2kabhishek/Dotfiles), but with my files and configurations.

### Installation

``` bash
git clone git@github.com/ncarn2/dotfiles.git ~/
ash ./dotfiles/setup.sh
```

This should prompt you to install oh-my-zsh, zsh, or vim plugins. After you have the desired plugins installed, you can run option 4 which will setup your symlinks.
